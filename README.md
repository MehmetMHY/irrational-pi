## Credit

This project was inspired by **@fascinating.fractals** and his [video](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/aUDYWYqtAR4) on drawing the irrational Pi. So massive credit to this amazing creator!

## Built With

### Tools

- [Cursor IDE](https://www.cursor.com/)

- [Claude App](https://claude.ai/chats)

- [ChatGPT App](https://chat.openai.com/chat)

- [Cha](https://github.com/MehmetMHY/cha/)

- [Gemini App](https://gemini.google.com/app)

### Models Used

- Claude 3.7 Sonnet

- Google Gemini 2.5 Pro

- OpenAI o3

### How It Was Built

1. Used **Cha** to extract the content and description from **@fascinating.fractals** [video](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/aUDYWYqtAR4).

2. The content as a prompt was inputted into [Claude App](https://claude.ai/chats) to generate a prototype and render it though their **Interactive Artifact** side window. Claude's **Claude 3.7 Sonnet** was used for this entire process.

3. After the prototype was good enough and I ran out of free chat memory, I created a local [git](https://git-scm.com/) project and transferred the code from Claude's web app to this local git project.

4. After transferring it, I opened the local project with the **Cursor IDE**, were I have a Pro plan, and I utilized **Claude 3.7 Sonnet** and **Google Gemini 2.5 Pro** to finish implementing the project itself. I did use the **ChatGPT** and **Gemini** web apps to generate ideas and feed it into the **Cursor IDE** to fix more complex bugs. In **ChatGPT** I utilized OpenAI's **o3** model and in **Gemini** I used their **Google Gemini 2.5 Pro** model.

5. I tested the project in my browser by just opening the single index HTML file in my browser.
